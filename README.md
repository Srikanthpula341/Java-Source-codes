# 30-Day Mastery in Java and DSA

This repository is dedicated to two intensive 30-day schedules designed for mastering Java programming and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java. Each schedule is structured into weekly themes that progressively cover fundamental, intermediate, and advanced topics.

## Repository Structure

This repository is divided into two main sections:

1. **Java Programming** - Located under `com.sri.java.basic`
2. **Data Structures and Algorithms** - Located under `com.sri.dsa.basic`

Each section contains subdirectories corresponding to each week of the study plan, filled with relevant examples, exercises, and notes.

### Java Programming

The Java section is designed to take you from basic syntax and concepts all the way through advanced features of Java, including Java 8 enhancements.

- **Week 1:** Basics of Java
- **Week 2:** Intermediate Java
- **Week 3:** Advanced Java and Java 8 Features
- **Week 4:** Building Applications and Further Study

### Data Structures and Algorithms

The DSA section focuses on implementing various data structures and solving algorithms that are crucial for coding interviews and competitive programming.

- **Week 1:** Basic Data Structures
- **Week 2:** Intermediate Data Structures
- **Week 3:** Advanced Algorithms
- **Week 4:** Practice and Problem Solving

## Usage

Each directory contains a set of Java files and text files that provide a practical introduction to the topics discussed. You can compile and run each Java file individually to see the concepts in action.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, especially from those who are also following the schedules. Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit a pull request.
